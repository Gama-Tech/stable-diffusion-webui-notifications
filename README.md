# Stable-diffusion-webui-notifications
Audio notificaitons for Stable Diffusion WebUI

This extension plays a sound effect once image generation is complete.
The example audio file is the AOL "You've got pictures!" sound effect, but you can choose custom sounds in .wav and .mp3 formats.
You can set notifications to only trigger if generation takes over a certain amount of time, useful if you only want notifications for longer generation batches.
You can enable/disable notifications at runtime without needing to restart the WebUI.

##To-Do
* Add error modals for incorrect settings
* Make the audio play via the web browser rather than the host machine
